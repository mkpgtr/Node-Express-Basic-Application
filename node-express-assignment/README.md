# Fairly simple app to display data when a certain endpoint is hit

# Endpoints : 

    /createStudent => POST request
    /allStudents => GET request
    /student/:id => GET request
    /topper/ => GET request

# /createStudent 

1. Three objects are entered via Postman.

# The purpose of this application is an assignment submission.

# Things I learnt :

1. using node-persist.
2. setting and getting items from node-persist
3. Displaying them when a certain endpoint gets hit
